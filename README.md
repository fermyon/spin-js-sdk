# Archived `spin-js-sdk` docs

This repository exists solely to serve documentation for old versions of the SDK that were originally published under the @fermyon namespace on npm.

## Background
Before the Spin project was contributed to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a sandbox project, the SDK package were maintained and published by Fermyon under the `@fermyon` scope on npm.

As part of the first release after the contribution, the SDK was modularized, and each package began again at version 1.0.0 under the new Spin Framework structure. This version reset makes it impractical to maintain old and new documentation together.

## Why This Repository Exists

- To preserve documentation for SDK versions published under @fermyon/*

- For historical reference and compatibility with older projects

- No active development or updates are planned for this repository
